Bug reporting
==============

Any and all bug reports are greatly appreciated in order to improve FEASST.

The following checklist are recommended in order to aid in reproducibility so that I can get back to you sooner.

* Reproduce the issue with a minimal script/example which reduces the amount of complexity, run time and file size.
* Provide all output.
* Provide the version (e.g. bash command "git describe --abbrev=10 --dirty --always --tags").
* Provide the script (C++ with int main() or .py).
