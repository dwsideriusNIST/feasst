This calculation is accomplished via Widom Insertion to obtain N=1 state spatial
averages, using FEASST to generate the ghost insertions and perform energy
calculations.
It is based on the Henry coefficient calculation described in "Toward Rational
Design of Metalâ€“Organic Frameworks for Sensing Applications: Efficient
Calculation of Adsorption Characteristics in Zero Loading Regime" by L.
Sarkisov, <em>J Phys Chem C</em>, 116(4):3025-3033, 2012

Requirements: This FEASST Script uses a specific branch and commit of the FEASST
source code, release tag v0.6.0
(https://github.com/usnistgov/feasst/releases/tag/v0.6.0),
as it utilizes tutorial-specific functions.
Checkout the specific release of FEASST via:

git checkout v0.6.0
